<p>In 1967, North Webster, Indiana (pop. 1,146) had a problem. Even though Indiana 13, a major highway, ran through the town, few people stopped and the economy was failing. Local banker Homer Shoop decided to take action. For some reason, he decided that the best way to remedy this was to theme the town into a kitschey version of Camelot. The donut shop became, Ye Old Double Dip and Dunk, the liquor store, Kingâ€™s Keg Package Liquor. They even held a yearly mermaid fair but, the crown jewel of the &quot;camelotification&quot; was the International Palace of Sports. The Palace was a sight to be seen. It had fountains, wax statues, oil paintings, a banquet hall, and most importantly a gift shop. Every year a &quot;King of Sports&quot; was crowned.</p>
<p>The inaugural king was O.J. Simpson. O.J. was paraded through the streets on a float and commemorative coins were made in his honor...</p>
<p>I'm handed an object. It's a gold coin, roughly the size of a silver dollar. One side reads, &quot;Knights and Ladies of the Year - International Palace of Sports&quot; and has a picture of some sort of castle, the other reads, &quot;1973 King of Sports&quot; and has a picture of O.J. Simpson. My mind begins turning. What is the International Palace of Sports? Was this before or after his arrest? Why was this coin made?</p>
<p>Where do I turn?</p>
<p>15 years ago I would have had to settle for nothing. My questions would go unanswered. I would observe the details of O.J.'s afro and the glimmer of his eyes. I would turn the coin over in my hands and comment on its rough edges.</p>
<p>Today, I gloss over those things. Instead, I head straight to Google and begin to search. This instinct is something new, something my generation, the Google generation, is the first to experience. We have been trained to expect a world where information are at our fingertips and it has changed the way we perceive objects.</p>
<p>Google changed the way we perceive the world around us. Information isn't just for the smart, well-read, elite anymore. I could know everything there is to know about something. But, no matter the topic, someone with a smartphone and an internet connection knows more. We know have everything there is to know about anything available at the touch of a button.</p>
