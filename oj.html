<p>In 1967, North Webster, Indiana (pop. 1,146) had a problem. Even though Indiana 13, a major highway, ran through the town, few people stopped and the economy was failing. Local banker Homer Shoop decided to take action. For some reason, he decided that the best way to remedy this was to theme the town into a kitschey version of Camelot. The donut shop became, Ye Old Double Dip and Dunk, the liquor store, Kingâ€™s Keg Package Liquor. They held a yearly mermaid fair however, the crown jewel of the &quot;camelotification&quot; was the International Palace of Sports. The Palace was a sight to be seen. It had fountains, wax statues, oil paintings, a banquet hall, and most importantly a gift shop. Every year a &quot;King of Sports was crowned&quot;.</p>
<p>The inaugural king was O.J. Simpson. O.J. was paraded through the streets on a float and commemorative coins were made in his honor.</p>
<p>That's how I found this wild story, through a coin and Google.</p>
<p>I'm handed an object. It's a gold coin, roughly the size of a silver dollar. One side reads, &quot;Knights and Ladies of the Year - International Palace of Sports&quot; and has a picture of some sort of castle, the other reads, &quot;1973 King of Sports&quot; and has a picture of O.J. Simpson. My mind begins turning. What is the International Palace of Sports? Was this before or after his arrest? Why was this coin made? My next step was something my grandfather could have never done, I Googled.</p>
<p>I started small, searching for</p>
<p>-Story -Google, and the rest of the internet, has changed the way we perceive objects</p>
