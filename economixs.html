<p>This article is about a decrease in the trade deficit. Our trade deficit is the amount by which our imports exceed our exports. The way we decreased our deficit was by increasing the amount we export. The article also discusses the fact that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits rose. These two statistics conflict because one is a positive economic indicator while the other is a negative indicator.</p>

<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/business/economy/american-economy-on-the-verge-of-a-double-dip-recession.html</p>
<p>This article is about rising fears of a recession. It discusses patterns that occur in which recessions happen immediately after periods of large spending. It cites staggering statistics about job loss and unemployment. It notes that even if the economy stagnates and doesn't continue to worsen it will plunge us into a recession because the job creation rates are so low. The article points out that forecasters are often inaccurate; while they are not ignorant as to economic change, they often underestimate it.</p>
